# AD9850_WSPR
WSPR transmitter using AD9850 dds

Processor used is Chipkit uc32.  A QRP Labs Arduino shield is used to tie all parts together.

Project change to Teensy LC and Si5351 clock module.  The DDS did not do well above 40 mhz.

Adding DIGI single tone transmit and receive as well as standalone WSPR.

Used the AS9850 in a completely different wspr tx with PC16F690 processor.

And made a Si5351 version with Pic16F690 as the DDS seems to have issues with heat.
